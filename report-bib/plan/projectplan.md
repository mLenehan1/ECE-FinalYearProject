# Project Plan

As the project spans two college semesters, the workload has been divided
across the semesters. While the first college semester has more modules in
the first semester, less time is available to work on the project.
As such, the work done on the project in this semester will mainly be research
focused, with information being gathered which may be helpful in furthering the
progress of the project. The second semester contains less taught module hours,
and as such, much of the project will be completed in this semester. The plans
laid out below are non-exhaustive, not listing any work to be completed between
semesters, and do not account for time spent on the project report, or
concurrency in completing tasks.
