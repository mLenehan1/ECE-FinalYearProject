# Introduction

There are many options for open-source audio streaming available to users.
While subscription based options such as Spotify exist, and there are options
for the playback of locally stored media, an optimal solution would serve both
options to listeners, to any connected device.

This project explores the idea of implementing a streaming server which allows
users access a stored collection of audio, from any connected device, and to
stream this audio to the nearest available client device. A solution must offer
an accessible user experience, and importantly provide good quality playback.
