## Listener Tracking

Mobile tracking has a number of ethical implications, imposing on an individuals
right to privacy. Access to a users location data must be privileged, accessible
only when necessary, and only from the application requiring the data. Bluetooth
beacons, as used within this project, have the capacity for two-way
communication. As such, there is the concern of the information being
intercepted, which could lead to malicious use of the captured
data\cite{bleprivacy}.

As proximity based services become more common, it becomes increasingly
important to ensure the protection of a users personal data, and location
information. Both the Apple App Store, and Google Play Store require that any
application which requires access to location services, or to bluetooth services
request permission from the user to access these services. This allows users the
ability to block applications accessing this information. Furthermore, laws have
been introduced prohibiting companies from using personal data from
non-consenting users\cite{proxmarketing}. Transparency is required throughout
the privacy policies of applications and services, in order to correctly inform
users of the data being accessed, and the storage and usage conditions of this
data.
