## Audio Tracks

While there have been questions raised in recent years over the ethical problems
with streaming services, and the revenue paid to artists whose music is played
via their platforms, there are also a number of issues with audio piracy from users
illegally downloading audio tracks. As solutions such as the one provided by
this project offer both options for both streaming and locally stored audio,
these ethical issues must be explored in order to determine the impact that a
solution such as this may have.

### Streaming Solutions

With the large increase in paying subscribers in audio streaming services, such
as Spotify, in the last number of years questions have arisen with regards to
the payment received by artists. Spotify, which, as of 2018\cite{SpotPay18} is the largest audio
streaming service, with a paying subscriber count of approximately 96 million as
of Q4 2018\cite{SpotSubs18}, as displayed in Figure \ref{PayingSubs}, has been criticized for the payment which the
artists on its service receive. More popular artists, who hold a larger percentage
of the rights to their music can earn between \$0.006 and \$0.0084 per stream.
Studies have shown that per million plays, an artist generates approximately
\$7,000 on Spotify, or approximately \$1,650 on Pandora\cite{CNBCSpot18}.

While Spotify and other streaming services may provide users with unprecedented
access to audio, it has been noted that the effect it has had on audio track
sales could be a detriment to artist income. A paper co-authored by Spotify's
Director of Economics has examined the "pro-rata" model used by Spotify to
distribute subscriber income, which is based on an artists percentage of total
track plays, concluding that a pro-rata model is beneficial to artists over a
user-centric model when, in the case of \$70 million distributable income,
increasing system costs exceed 4.64%\cite{allocateRevenue}.

Conversely, a 2017 paper from Digital Media Finland explores the benefits of the
user-centric system\cite{rataVuser}. This study shows that in the "pro-rata"
model, individual user habits are not accounted for, with subscription income
distributed across all tracks played. In a "user-centric" model, the subscription
income is distributed across all of the tracks played by the user. This is
beneficial to artists of less popular genres, giving their listeners the
opportunity to support the artists they listen to, without placing their money
in a pot for distribution.

With the significant increase in spending on streaming service subscriptions
over physical media sales, and digital downloads, as in Figure
\ref{StreamBecomesRiver}, the fair and equal payment of artists must be
considered. Artists of more niche genres can be negatively affected by the
currently used "pro-rata" models, however, the change to a "user-centric" model
may not benefit these artists, as they increase the processing costs at the side
of the streaming service. As such, care must be taken to ensure that artists
incomes are not so negatively affected so as to reduce the number of smaller
artists within the industry.

### Audio Piracy

When considering solutions which use locally stored audio, the ethical issue of
sourcing these audio tracks must be discussed. While it may be presumed that, with
the increase in the availability of audio streaming, audio piracy would
significantly decrease, it has been noted that audio piracy affects physical and
digital media consumption\cite{onlinePiracy}. While the Global Online Piracy
Study\cite{onlinePiracy} suggests that audio piracy is decreasing, MUSO, a
company aiming to study and solve issues with audio piracy, has stated in their
annual piracy report a 1.6\% increase in global piracy in 2017\cite{muso}. Joost
and Quintais however contest these figures, noting that MUSO "overestimate the
number of and visits to pirate websites"\cite{onlinePiracy}.

While piracy via illegal downloads seems to be decreasing, only replacing the declining digital
and physical sales\cite{SpotPay18}, illegal streaming via personal licences
being used in place of business licences may be a more prominent issue, with a
survey showing 83\% of small business owners use a personal streaming service
account in their premises\cite{licence}.

Sourcing audio files from legal sources, such as physical or online retailers, is
important in order to ensure proper payment is received by artists and
production companies. The use of locally stored audio in this project may
however increase the use of pirated audio, due to a lack of accessibility to
these physical or digital media.
