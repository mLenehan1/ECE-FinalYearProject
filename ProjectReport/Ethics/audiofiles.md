## Audio Tracks

While there have been questions raised in recent years over the ethical problems
with streaming services, and the revenue paid to artists whose music is played
via their platforms, there are also a number of issues with audio piracy from users
illegally downloading audio tracks.

### Streaming Solutions

With the large increase in paying subscribers in audio streaming services, such
as Spotify, in the last number of years questions have arisen with regards to
the payment received by artists. Spotify, which, as of 2018\cite{SpotPay18} is the largest audio
streaming service, with a paying subscriber count of approximately 96 million as
of Q4 2018 \cite{SpotSubs18}, has been criticized for the payment which the
artists on its service receive. More popular artists, who hold a larger percentage
of the rights to their music can earn between \$0.006 and \$0.0084 per stream.
Studies have shown that per million plays, an artist generates approximately
\$7,000 on Spotify, or approximately \$1,650 on Pandora\cite{CNBCSpot18}.
