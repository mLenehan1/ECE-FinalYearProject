# Introduction

There are many options for open-source audio streaming available to users. A
number of configurations of the available open-source audio streaming hardware
and software allow for end-users to play locally stored audio on a so-called
"Headless" system, whereby the server software is controlled remotely by the
user.

In recent years, a movement away from locally stored audio solutions has taken
place. Subscription based audio streaming services such as Spotify exist to allow
users access audio which they have no access to physical copies of. While this
trend exists, an optimal server software solution would serve both locally
stored, and streaming audio options to listeners.

This project explores the idea of implementing a streaming server which allows
users access a stored collection of audio, from any connected device, and to
stream this audio to the nearest available client device. A solution must offer
an accessible user experience, and importantly provide good quality playback,
achieved through the combination of chosen software and hardware.
