# Abstract

Open-Source audio server softwares are numerous. The most popular available
options for embedded linux devices are intended for use as "headless" audio
devices, controlled over the network, and outputting their audio locally. With a
large number of subscription based audio streaming services available, such as
Spotify, Tidal, and Google Play Music, there is an increasing need for an option
to stream a users own music, from a central storage device, to their client
device of choice. 

The addition of listener tracking allows a user to play audio through multiple
speakers as they traverse a space, such as their home, without needing to play
music through all available speakers, or without turning device volumes up or
down.
